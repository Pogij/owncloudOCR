v2.0-rc1 (2014-01-07):
====

New features
------------

- Huge performance improvement on machines having multiple CPU/cores (processing of several pages concurrently) (fixes #18)
- By default prevent from processing a PDF file already containing fonts (i.e. text)(it can be overridden with the -f flag) (fixes #16)
- Warn if the resolution is too low to get reasonable OCR results (fixes #37)
- New option (-o) to perform automatic oversampling if the image resolution is too low. This can improve OCR results.
- Warn if using a tesseract version older than v3.02.02 (as older versions are known to produce invalid output) (fixes #41)
- Echo version of the installed dependencies (e.g. tesseract) in debug mode in order to ease support (fixes #35)
- Echo the arguments passed to the script in debug mode to ease support

Changes
-------

- In debug mode: The debug page is now placed after the respective "normal" page
- Reduced disk space usage in temporary folder if -d (deskew) or -c (cleanup) options are not selected
- New file src/config.sh containing various configuration parameters
- Documentation of the tesseract config file "tess-cfg/no_ligature" improved 
- Improved consistency of the temporary file names

Fixes
-----

- Improved robustness:
   - in case vertical resolution differs from horizontal resolution (fixes #38)
   - in case a PDF page contains more than one image (fixes #36)
- Fix a problem occurring if python 3 is the standard interpreter (fixes #33)
- Fix a problem occurring if the input PDF file contains special characters like "#" (fixes #34)
