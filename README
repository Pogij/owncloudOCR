Images OCR is Owncloud app that provides OCR reading of images and PDF files that contains text in images.
For this app to work user (server admin) has to install tesseract program. With tesseract installed 
owncloud users will be able to execute OCR reading using installed traineddate languages.
For pdf reading app uses OCRmyPDF scripts available on web address https://github.com/fritz-hh/OCRmyPDF.

OCRmyPDF requires java runtime environment and python installed. It also requires tesseract version
3.02 or greater (version 3.02.02 is prefered). PDF reading is only available on UNIX like server OS (images
OCR on Windows OS will only be able to run images reading and not PDF OCR reading).
